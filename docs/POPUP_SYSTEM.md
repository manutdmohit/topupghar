# Editable Popup System

This document describes the new editable popup system that allows administrators to customize the welcome popup that appears when users visit the website.

## Features

- **Editable Content**: Admins can modify title, message, features, and CTA button text
- **Display Settings**: Control when and how often the popup appears
- **Frequency Control**: Choose between once, daily, weekly, or always
- **Customizable Delay**: Set how long to wait before showing the popup
- **Active/Inactive Toggle**: Enable or disable the popup entirely
- **Real-time Preview**: See changes as you edit them

## Database Schema

The popup data is stored in a MongoDB collection with the following structure:

```typescript
interface Popup {
  title: string; // Popup title
  message: string; // Main message content
  features: string[]; // List of feature bullet points
  ctaText: string; // Call-to-action button text
  isActive: boolean; // Whether popup is enabled
  showDelay: number; // Delay before showing (in milliseconds)
  frequency: '2hours'; // Fixed to show every 2 hours
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Public Endpoint

- `GET /api/popup` - Fetch current popup content for visitors

### Admin Endpoints

- `GET /api/admin/popup` - Fetch popup data for editing (requires admin auth)
- `PUT /api/admin/popup` - Update popup content (requires admin auth)

## Admin Interface

### Access

Navigate to `/admin/dashboard/popup` in the admin panel to access the popup management interface.

### Features

1. **Basic Settings**

   - Title: The main heading of the popup
   - Message: The descriptive text below the title
   - CTA Button Text: The text on the call-to-action button

2. **Features Management**

   - Add/remove feature bullet points
   - Each feature is displayed with a green dot icon

3. **Display Settings**

   - Show Delay: Time in milliseconds before the popup appears - Frequency: Fixed to show every 2 hours
   - Active Toggle: Enable/disable the popup

4. **Live Preview**
   - See exactly how the popup will look as you edit
   - Real-time updates as you type

## User Experience

### Frequency Logic

- **Fixed 2 Hours**: Popup shows every 2 hours based on timestamp comparison

### Storage

The system uses localStorage to track popup visibility:

- `hasSeenWelcomeModal`: Boolean flag for once frequency
- `lastModalShown`: Timestamp for daily/weekly frequency

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup

Run the seeding script to create the initial popup:

```bash
node scripts/seed-popup.js
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Ensure your `.env` file contains:

```
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### 3. Admin Access

Make sure you have admin privileges to access the popup management interface.

## Customization Examples

### Welcome Message

```
Title: "Welcome to Our Store! ðŸŽ‰"

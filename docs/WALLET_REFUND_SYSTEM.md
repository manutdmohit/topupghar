# Wallet Refund System Documentation

## Overview

The wallet refund system automatically processes refunds when admin rejects orders that were paid using wallet balance. This ensures users don't lose money when their orders are rejected.

## How It Works

### 1. **Order Creation Flow**

- User pays with wallet â†’ Balance deducted immediately
- Order status set to `pending` (not `approved`)
- Admin reviews the order
- If approved â†’ Order proceeds normally
- If rejected â†’ Automatic refund processed

### 2. **Refund Process**

When admin rejects a wallet-paid order:

1. **Detection**: System detects status change to 'rejected' for wallet payment
2. **Validation**: Checks if order was paid with wallet
3. **Refund Processing**:
   - Creates refund transaction record
   - Adds amount back to user's wallet balance
   - Updates wallet statistics
4. **Notification**: Sends confirmation to admin and logs

### 3. **User Experience**

- **Before Payment**: Clear warning about pending admin review
- **After Payment**: Order shows as pending
- **If Rejected**: Automatic refund with transaction record
- **Wallet History**: Refund transactions clearly marked
